Interactive slides for creating a simple music peace from scratch, in 4 minutes.

[![The presentation](http://img.youtube.com/vi/F3wmTsC_rbI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3wmTsC_rbI)

overtone.org contains the slides, I've been using org-tree-slide.el for running it.

overtone-notes.org contains the narrative.

Created during hackweek at Spotify 2014
